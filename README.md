Project 1 - What is that vegetable

This is a website that has pictures of vegetables with information about the vegetable and recipes. The initial 10 vegetables were chosen due to their rarity in the American market or more intimidating nature to a cook who isn't very comfortable in the kitchen.

The site is hosted on Heroku here:

Wireframes and user stories are included in the Trello tracking tool for the project:

Future Development
	1. Include the Wikipedia API to provide more information about the vegetable.
	2. Implement comments in the recipe section that will allow users to comment.
	3. Include more than 10 veggies.
	4. Allow users to search for any veggie they might be looking for.
